(*) Record and tuple are equivalent.

("a", true);
val it = ("a",true) : string * bool

("a", true) = {1 = "a", 2 = true};

(*) Empty record and empty tuple are equivalent, and of type 'unit'.

(*) Variable with polymorphic type
val x = List_map;

(*) Has polymorphic type

val len = fn : 'a list -> int
